   - Cross-platform builds (Android + iOS)
   - Artifact uploads and retention

2. **`.github/workflows/quality-check.yml`**
   - Code quality validation
   - TypeScript compilation checks
   - Security audits
   - Formatting validation

3. **`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`**
   - Production deployments on git tags
   - Automated GitHub releases
   - Production build profiles

### 📚 Documentation Created

- **`GITHUB_ACTIONS_SETUP.md`**: Comprehensive setup guide
- **`README.md`**: Project documentation with badges
- **`scripts/setup-github-actions.js`**: Setup verification script

### 🔧 Scripts Added

- **`npm run setup-actions`**: Verify GitHub Actions setup
- All existing scripts maintained and enhanced

## 🚀 What Happens Next

### 1. Push to GitHub
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add GitHub Actions workflows"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Set Up Secrets
1. Go to [Expo Dashboard](https://expo.dev)
2. Create an access token
3. Add `EXPO_TOKEN` to GitHub repository secrets

### 3. Watch the Magic
- Every push triggers quality checks
- Every push triggers automated builds
- Every git tag creates a production release

## 🎯 Workflow Triggers

| Action | Workflow | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Push to main | EAS Build + Quality Check | Development builds & validation |
| Pull Request | Quality Check | Code review validation |
| Git Tag (v*) | Deploy | Production release |

## 📱 Build Outputs

- **Android**: APK and AAB files
- **iOS**: IPA files
- **Artifacts**: Stored for 30 days
- **Releases**: Automatic GitHub releases

## 🔍 Monitoring

- **GitHub Actions Tab**: Real-time workflow status
- **Build Logs**: Detailed build information
